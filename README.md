## Features

- **Resting Membrane Potential (RMP) Analysis**: Calculate and visualize RMP.
- **Spike Frequency Analysis**: Determine spontaneous action potential frequencies.
- **Amplitude Calculation**: Measure action potential amplitudes within specified voltage ranges.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform ANOVA and descriptive statistics.
- **Baseline Adjustment**: Normalize and clean electrophysiology data.
